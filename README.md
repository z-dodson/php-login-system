# php-login-system

A very simple login system with php which includes change password options, just here so Luka can copy it realy

It uses files and protected directories to store data

This has just been copid off my website and cleaned up slightly so it may be that it dosn't entirly work as Iv'e not tested it specifically, if not you can raise an issue

You need to make the directory _private_ private
